## Progress 
  ## Done 
  [x] Set up build environment on personal computer

  ## Doing 
  [x] Starter project (Basic SIR model)
  [] Additional features to the SIR model 
    - People moving along a random walk 

  ## Further down the line
  [] Additional features to the SIR model 
    - Spatial dependence of infection
    - Implementing vaccinations 
  [] Compare simulation results to real data 

  ## ....any further steps
